# Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager
> :warning: :warning: :warning: **Please note:** This project is no longer officially maintained. In an attempt to focus our maintenance efforts, we have decided to stop the maintenance of some projects, including this one. This means that there will be no further feature updates or bugfixes planned for this app (exceptions only in cases of severe security or privacy issues). Consequently, the app has also been removed from the stores.
If someone is interested in taking over the maintenance of this app, please do not hesitate to contact us: pfa@secuso.org

Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager controls the WiFi of your device automatically depending on your current location. The intent of this Android app is to provide a possibility to (de-) activate the device's WiFi according to preset rules. Triggers include cell tower location and a time schedule.

## Motivation
By switching off the device's WiFi when it is not required, so-called tracking via WiFi is avoided. Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager also saves battery life by automatically disabling your device's WiFi in case it is not near an already known WiFi network. As it is developed as a practical work for the SECUSO research group of the Technische Universtität Darmstadt in Germany, the main motivation lies in providing a useful app using minimum permissions. Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group. This also implies that we put a stress on preserving the user's privacy. More information about the Privacy Friendly Apps can be found at https://secuso.org/pfa
